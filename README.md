The original work (Friggeri Resume/CV Template v1.0, 2013-05-05) was created by Adrien Friggeri (adrien@friggeri.net).

I have modified it slightly to make it use only free fonts and to make it correctly padded for A4 paper sizes.

Please note that not all copies of 'cv.pdf' written to this directory are published to my website - I update the revision of the submodule only when a meaningful change has happened (i.e. not just a rebuild for a dependency change).
